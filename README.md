## Stable Diffusion
* Introuced in 2022 - from German (HH - Those who get it , get it)
* Text - Image ( helps in creating a image from the text prompt you give to it)
    * Diffusion model is a generative model
    * Learn probability distribution from the data , so that we can sample from distribution to create a new image (which dont exist)
    * **Why distributions ?** 
        * Example - Criminal wants to create fake identity (age and height)
            * Gather the statistics of the information of the all the people , and draw the probability distributions
            * So we have the distributions for the **age** and **height**
            * We sample from these distributions (means - how we sample ?)
                * **Approach - 1**
                    * Take random from the **age** and **height** , which could be your possible fake identity
                    * But they can be random and not make sense
                * **Approach - 2** (Joint Distribution)
                    * As **age** and **height** are dependent variables , we have to consider them as joint distribution .
                    * Choose from the joint distribution - to model something 
                    * This is what we do with our images too
                    * Each `pixel is a distribution` , and entirity of all the pixels is a **Large Joint Distribution**
                        * **Marginalizing**
                            * Lets say x = height and y = age , then we can calculate the p(x) , over all the ages 
                            * This is using the `Conditional Prrobability`
    * **Goal**
        * Our data as a very big **Gaint Distribution**
        * Use NN to learn the complex distribution
        * Sample from the complex distribution to generate the **fake data**
    * **Latent Variable**
        * *Forward/Diffusion Process* - Original image to a noise image
            * We have our initial image 
            * Add some noise to the image , and generate another image , same as the previous but with some noise
            * Take the new image and add some more noise to it , generate another image with even more noise
            * Repeat the process upto 1000+ steps (Full noise image)
            * This process is `Fixed` , and a standard process to do this
        * *Reverse Process*
            * But the reverse is not possible  , so we train a NN to do this
            * The reverse process  , is done by the NN
    * **Maths for Staffusion**
        * The next state of the noise image , is generated by a bayessian relation between the states
        * Refer to slides for better understanding  (Credit - Umar Jamil)
        * We can also go from original image , to a image at a time stamp `t` , by sampling from the distribution .
