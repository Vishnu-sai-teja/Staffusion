## Attention Mechanism mathematics
- Similatiy between words
    * Dot product
    * Cosine similarity
- Key , Query , Value matrices as linear transformations


## Embeddings
* Words or longer peice of words , that are learnt to be put together
    - Examples , fruits are put together , electronics together
    - Words that are close , gets pulled together and that are not similar gets pulled away
    - For example we are having a  bunch of fruits alread in it , then it would be able to identify when another fruit and comes together

## Similarity
* Words are measured with similarity between them
    * When words are similar the similarity is high (orange and bananas)
    * When words are not so similar , we get low similarit (oranges and laptop)
* **How To Measure this Similarity**
    * There are three ways to measure the similairty
    * **Dot Porduct**
